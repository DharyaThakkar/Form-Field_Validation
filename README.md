In this project I have validated the form fields which are filled by the user to check whether it is valid or 
invalid.For adding this functionality, i have used the concept of "Regular Expression(also abbreviated
as regex)". I have created a regex for each form field and I am checking it against each input data 
provided by the user.


Technologies used:-
HTML5,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.
